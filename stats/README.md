## getData.R

Change the working directory of the script.

Download the results files into a folder, then run this script, changing the 'backupfolder' variable to the location of the folder.

This will produce files ../results/Results_UK.csv and ../results/Results_USA.csv, relative to the working directory.

## geocode.R

Take the output of getData.R and geocode some columns.
