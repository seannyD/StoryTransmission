The research is funded by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany.<br />You will be asked to listen to 2 stories, each about 7 minutes long. You will then be given a short memory test and asked to recall the stories in as much detail as possible. Your response will be recorded using your microphone (no video). We then ask you to evaluate a few short recordings of speech by rating them on a number of characteristics. At the end of the survey, we also ask that you answer a brief set of questions about yourself and your background.<br />Participation should take approximately 60 minutes. There will be sections of the survey that are time- sensitive, during which you will not be able to walk away from your computer. You will be notified before beginning these sections.<br />Your participation in this research is voluntary. If you decide to participate in the study, you may withdraw your consent and stop participation at any time without penalty. We will not collect your name or any personal identifiers. When we report and share the data with others, we will combine the data from all participants. There are no known risks to you in taking part in this study. If you have any questions, contact information for the researchers, the CSU Institutional Review Board, and the UB Human Research Ethics Committee are available at the end of the questionnaire.<br /><br />If you agree to participate, please press the button below.\n",
