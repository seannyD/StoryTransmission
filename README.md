# StoryTransmission

This version includes:

-  Localisation
-  Demographic survey
-  Playing story audio (just my voice for testing)
-  Distraction task
-  Recording audio (please don't record anything longer than a few seconds for now!)
-  Converting and saving audio to mp3 (this happens asynchronously, so you may be asked to wait at the end of the experiment)
-  Playing evaluation story
-  Voice evaluation survey
-  Returning worker code

It does not include:

-  Nice styling
-  Instructions for the distraction task
-  Instructions in general
-  I'm not sure this will handle long recordings, but we'll see

If you add a url variable "test=T" to the url, then you get some configuration options (Some of this works, other bits I haven't tested):
