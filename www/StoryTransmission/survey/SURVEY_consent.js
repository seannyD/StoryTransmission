We are currently exploring some of the concepts involved in how people are perceived and how this affects cultural transmission.\n<br /><br />\nThis work is a collaboration between Dr. Michael Gavin and Richard Berl in the Department of Human Dimensions of Natural Resources at Colorado State University and Dr. Fiona Jordan and Alarna Samarasinghe in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Bristol. The research is funded by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany.\n<br /><br />\nYou will be asked to evaluate 11 short (~40 second) recordings of speech by rating them on a number of characteristics. At the end of the survey, we also ask that you answer a brief set of questions about yourself and your background. Participation should take approximately 30 minutes. Your participation in this research is voluntary. If you decide to participate in the study, you may withdraw your consent and stop participation at any time without penalty.\n<br /><br />\nWe will not collect your name or any personal identifiers. When we report and share the data with others, we will combine the data from all participants. There are no known risks to you in taking part in this study. If you have any questions, contact information for the researchers, the CSU Institutional Review Board, and the UB Human Research Ethics Committee are available at the end of the questionnaire.\n<br /><br />\nIf you agree to participate, please continue to the next section.\n",
